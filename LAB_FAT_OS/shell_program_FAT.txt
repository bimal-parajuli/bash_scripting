Write a shell program for the following operation:
Get a sentence from the user (all words in lower-case) such that it ends with “done”. Count the number of words (n) excluding done and print the count followed by central word (if count is even then n/2-1th word and if it odd n/2th). n should be minimum 4.
Sample:
 
Input:
Hello
my
name
is
something
done
 
Output:
5
name













Code:

#! /bin/bash

#array of string to store the wordws of sentence.
sentence=() 

while [ true ];
do

    # get input from user.
    read word
    
    # If word is done, break loop.
    if [ $word = "done" ]
    then
        break;
    fi
    
    # ammend word to sentence array.
    sentence+=($word)
    
done


#Counting the total number of words in the sentence array.
word_count=${#sentence[@]}  

#display the number of words.
echo $word_count


# checking whether word count is odd  or even.

remainder=`expr $word_count%2`
if [ $remainder -eq 0]
then
    center=$(($word_count / 2))
    center=$(($center - 1))
else
    center=$(($word_count / 2))
fi

# extracting the middle one from the sentence.
middle_string=${sentence[$center]}

# Displaying the middle word in small.
echo ${middle_string,,}
